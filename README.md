# youtube-to-mp3-api
This is an API I'm going to use for my personal upcoming mobile application.

## Quick Start
To install dependencies. If you have `pipenv` installed:
```
$ pipenv install
```
Or:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br/>

Then to start the server:
```
uvicorn api.main:app
```
